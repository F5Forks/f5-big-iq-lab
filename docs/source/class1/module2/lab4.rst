If this application includes a client-SSL profile, and the Ciphers are editable, there are three potential cipher settings you can configure.
You can inherit the settings from the parent profile, you can specify a cipher of your own, or you can select a cipher group.

To inherit the cipher settings from the parent profile:
For Ciphers, select Inherit.
For Cipher Group Override as None, select Inherit.
For Cipher Group, select Inherit.
To specify a cipher for this application:
For Ciphers, select Other, and then type the cipher text in the adjacent field.
For Cipher Group Override as None, select Other and None.
For Cipher Group, select Inherit.
To specify a cipher group for this application:
For Ciphers, select Other, and then leave the adjacent field blank.
For Cipher Group Override as None, select Inherit.
