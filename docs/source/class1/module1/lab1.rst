Lab 1.1: Personas
-----------------

- What Happened?

The Personas creation were initiated by the Blue team.
They were refreshed, updated, and validated and are intended for company-wide consumption.

- 5 “new” personas

1. Marco -> David: Automation
2. Paula: Somewhat less hands-on
3. Olivia: Initial app liaison; provides infrastructure, not apps
4. Alex -> Tony:	Similar
5. Larry/Noah -> Chris:	Different role? More Ops
